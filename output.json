DOGE holders are now panick selling ( It has dropped a lot since the end of SNL , Elon failed , really hard ) , ETH and BTC are stalling , and easy money come from high volatility , expectation , and shitcoins . The ones that are selling DOGE are coming here , my guess is DOGE is going to fall a little , still Top 10 Capitalization , but its revenues are coming here in SHIB , which is sure pumping a little , but it 's all DOGE money , we are literally killing DOGE and SHIB is standing to its nickname , 0.0001 is highly possible in the next 48 hours , with the expectation of SHIBASWAP opening ! To reach 0.0001 we just need a cap of 39.5B , which is only HALF of DOGE , so this is really possible !",
